    <center><h1>From The Box to The Shell - Setting up a Headless Raspberry Pi</h1></center>

    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to set up a Raspberry Pi to be headless, or without a monitor, that we can connect to through SSH. This will be very useful for setting up 
        Raspberry Pi Zero W boards because these use mini HDMI for display out, and you need a USB-OTG adapter to connect a mouse and keyboard. 
        You can set up any Raspberry Pi board in this way.
    </p>

    <h2>Materials:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Raspberry Pi that can connect to the internet (using built-in Wi-Fi or a dongle)</li>
        <li>Good quality SD card</li>
        <li>Micro-USB power supply for powering the board</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Software Used:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>PuTTY (or another SSH client). <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">Get PuTTY.</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download">Win32 Disk Imager</a></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 1:</h3>
    <p>The first step is to download the operating system the Raspberry Pi will use, I chose to use Raspbian, the official Raspberry Pi operating 
        system. You could use another operating system, but the steps to set up SSH may be slightly different. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Get Raspbian.</a> 
        Since we are setting up our Pi to work headless, we can choose the "lite" version of whatever operating system because 
        we do not need the desktop features. This saves space on our SD card, too.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2:</h3>
    <p>Next, use Win32 Disk Imager to write the operating system to the SD card.</p>
    <div class = "two">
        <div class = "image">
            <img src="images/win32disk.JPG" alt="Windows thirty two disk imager.">
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p>Select the downloaded operating system image with the blue folder icon.</p>
            <p><b>Make sure the correct drive is selected!</b></p>
            <p>Click "Write" to write the operating system to the SD card. This will take a while.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Step 3:</h3>
    <div class="block">
        <p>Next, we need to create a file that will let us use SSH on the Raspberry Pi. To improve security of connected devices, your Raspberry Pi operating 
            system will most likely have SSH disabled by default.
        </p>
        <p>You may need to eject your card and re-insert it into your PC to find the <b>/boot</b> directory.</p>
        <p>Rasbian needs an empty, extensionless file named <b>" ssh. "</b> in the /boot directory of the SD card to enable SSH. To do this on Windows, open Notepad and save a blank file with 
            the name <b>" ssh. "</b> and choose <b>All Files</b> for the Save as type. Move this file to the /boot directory. <b>note: the " . " at the end of ssh is important when 
            saving the SSH file otherwise Windows will make this a text file, even if we choose All Files for the Save as type.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Congratulations, you are now ready to plug in your Raspberry Pi!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Step 4:</h3>
    <div class="block">
        <p>Now we will plug in the Raspberry Pi to a power supply. While the Raspberry Pi boots for the first time, we need to find the IP 
            address of the Pi. There are many ways to do this, I logged into my home router to look at the connected devices because this was 
            easiest for me to do.
